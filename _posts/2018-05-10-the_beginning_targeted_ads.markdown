Welcome to my first blog ever. As part of my career transition into coding and web development, I've become a student at the Flatiron School, which requires that I write this blog. With it, I hope to demonstrate my technical knowledge, and in doing so provide  provide help to anyone who's already found themselves on this path, and inspire others to take a look at this exciting career path.

Now, let's start with how I got here...

### It was time for a Reboot

It was 2017. 

I wasn't happy with my career trajectory at the time, and I wasn't sure what I wanted to do with my life. I had graduated a few years earlier with an undergraduate degree in Sociology, and spent another two part-time on a Masters in Biology as I worked towards establishing a career in healthcare. After a decade of adulthood, my plans to enter into a career of medicine hadnâ€™t materialized into anything promising, and further investment into such endeavors would be too costly, both financially and in terms of time.

Sometimes, we get trapped in the pursuit of a goal or objective, and after investing so much time into a path, one may feel that after coming so far along, their only option is to continue going forward. Combine that with the idealism of having a positive impact on the world, and fulfillment of some grand purpose, taking a look at any alternatives was for me, unnerving.

Where do I redirect my future? What could I do with my current skill set that would enable me to have a decent living, explore my entrepreneur-ish ambitions, and affect change in the world?

Doubtful, and unsure of what to do, I decided I'd revamp myself. After about a decade of not having Facebook, I decided I would give it a good solid try. I re-established connections that I'd lost over the years. I allowed Linkedin to finally import all of my contacts and obtained as large a network as I possibly could with the people that I already knew. I'd take Steve Jobs' advice to heart, trusted that my dots would connect in the future somehow, and never settled, and instead remained hungry and foolish until the very end.

And so I applied for jobs within the scope of my experience, as well as a job here or there that I thought I could help me pivot into a new career. I had sent out dozens of applications to different positions, while at the same time dubious that I'd find anything that I could love, that would ignite me with the passion that I was looking for, or that I could genuinely infuse with my own creativity. What about that idealistic college student who thought he could positively impact the world?

### The Ad That Changed Everything

When utilizing free web apps today, one of the most disconcerting things that a typical user can come across is the realization that every advertisement that they see is usually related to some activity that they did on the web in the preceding hours or days. It's a cause of concern for a lot of people in regards to their online security and privacy. For example, if one were to simply do a Google search for "Mother's Day gifts," before you know it, in your Gmail inbox, Facebook feed, and elsewhere, **a lot** of the ads that you see will be related to just that. 

I had learned this primarily through Facebook over the few months that I was using it, and was rather interested in the connectivity between how a website I browsed or Google search I made, became a relevant NYTimes or Facebook ad. Then one day, while browsing through the mass of stories and articles across the web, I came across this:

Before this ad, I'd heard of computer science, but it wasn't anywhere on my radar... *at all.* Neither was software engineering, computer programming, etc. Growing up, I didn't know anyone in these fields. At most, my only experience in this world was an introduction to a class on HTML in high school.

So when I saw that I could become a web developer in 12 weeks, I had to explore it.

*What was this thing called web development? What was this thing called software engineering?* And could *anyone* really do it?

So explore, I did.

And I never looked back.

### The Journey

So I applied to this "school", thinking it was some sort of scam. Who'd ever heard of a coding bootcamp anyway? After receiving some prep material, I studied the essentials of Ruby, learned about while and for loops, variables, conditional statements, and more. I solved problems just for fun, all the while thoroughly enjoying the process. I saw web development as a potential way to shape the experience of many people across the globe. It was also a way to combine my love of mathematics and languages, and even my creativity. It was beautiful. *How could I not have known about this before?* The ability to work in any industry that I desired, while learning more about myself. This... this was it.

And days later, App Academy invited me down to NYC to participate in their two week Jump Start program. A program that made it possible for me to learn how to code live and see what learning at a coding bootcamp was like, then interview after at the end with higher chances of acceptance into their program which was known to already have a low acceptance rate at 5%. So I did what any *sane* person does, and in May 2017, I quit my jobs, called my contacts, and looked for a place to stay in NYC for two weeks.


App Academy's Jump Start program consisted of two parts, each of which were two weeks long, with an assessment to determine if you'd move on to the next step. So those that passed the first assessment, moved on to part two of the Jump Start program. Those that passed the second assessment were accepted into App Academy's coding boot camp. Failure of the second assessment had to be retaken online remotely with decreased chances for acceptance later.

I took my first assessment for the first part of their curriculum that I had access to online on my first day, and aced it.

I then joined the cohort that would take the second assessment.

I coded. I loved. 

Then I failed my second assessment. 

### Love isn't Easy

After my get up and leave everything behind move to NYC, and the failure that followed, I was now bombarded with self-doubt. *Does this mean coding is not for me? Should I quit?* I loved it too much to just throw it away, so I decided I'd just schlep my way back upstate, get another job and explore it further. After all, there was another opportunity to do a remote interview. 

In my quest to better prepare myself I searched for content, and then another Facebook ad came up. A free Bootcamp prep course offered by the Flatiron School. This course included both Ruby and Javascript, along with a little HTML and CSS. It appeared to be my golden ticket into getting me where I needed to go.

However, the real value in Flatiron School's bootcamp prep wasn't so much what I learned, it was Avi Flombaum's philosophical approach to coding. Here are just two of the excerpts from their content content by Avi:

> As you struggle and overcome challenges you're going to discover new parts of yourself: skills and talents you might never have known you had; you'll find a new delight in solving problems and the ability to find yourself when you're lost. Within you there is a never ending supply of strength and grit just waiting to be unlocked.

> Remember, nothing in the world worth knowing comes easily and you should never get intimidated just because something is hard. Difficult is not impossible and one of the most valuable things you're going to learn about is your limitless ability to overcome challenges. Have patience, all things are foreign before they become familiar.

That wisdom has stayed with me since, and has been integrated into my own philosophical approach to learning. As of February 20, 2018, I once more made the move down to NYC, and joined Flatiron School's software engineering immersive.
