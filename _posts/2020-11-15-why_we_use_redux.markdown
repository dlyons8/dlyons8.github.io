Recently I was asked about my React/Redux portfolio project in a job interview, why I used Redux if React was already so stateful? What was the justification? In that moment, I realized that the benefits of Redux in it's integration with React wasn't so clear to me, and I fumbled, and explained that I am no longer altogether too clear on the matter because I'd shifted my focus from frontend to backend, and also that the primary reason behind my use of integrating Redux into my React application was to learn and understand how it works. 

I did't feel too great about how that interview started, but nonetheless saw it as an opportunity to improve.
